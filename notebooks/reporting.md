# Health Data Insights Report

The reporting visualizes real-time predictions of patient illness using Looker Studio, based on streaming medical data classified by a trained ML model. It helps monitor health trends across age groups, genders, and key lab metrics for analytical insights.

## 1. Patient Age Overview
- X-Axis: 'age_group'
- Y-Axis: Record Count – the number of patient records in each age group

Insight:

- The equal and high record counts in the 18–34 and 65–79 age groups may reflect two key healthcare focuses: preventive care and early detection in younger adults, and chronic condition management in older adults.
- In contrast, the notably lower count in the 80+ group may suggest underrepresentation due to lower digital health adoption, limited access, or data gaps in very elderly populations.
- This could highlight the need for improved outreach or data collection strategies in that segment.
